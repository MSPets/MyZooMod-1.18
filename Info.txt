A common subpackage strategy has packages for common and client code, which is code that can be run on both server/client and only client, respectively.
Inside the common package would go things like Items, Blocks, and Block Entities (which can each, in turn, be another subpackage).
Things like Screens and Renderers would go inside the client package.

For Example:
An Item called PowerRing would be in an item package, with a class name of PowerRingItem.
A Block called NotDirt would be in a block package, with a class name of NotDirtBlock.
Finally, a BlockEntity for a block called SuperChewer would be a block.entity or blockentity package, with a class name of SuperChewerBlockEntity.
